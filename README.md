## About the project

Community Hub & Membership Platform - Vibele

```
This is Vibele, a community driven based webapp that has various communities and social events that help people interact online based on their activity. 
```

```
I took design inspirations from Reddit for the design and UI and made it as minimalistic and clean as possible.
```

```
I have included a Navbar with notification icon that shows notifications 2 buttons, a sidebar, the main posts feed and on the right the Upcoming events section along with the community members section.
```

```
I tried fitting everything in without making it very cluttered. Simple and clean was my goal and I think I achieved that based on the given assignment.
